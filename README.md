# Customer Segmentation with K-Means + PCA (Internship Project)

This project was completed as part of my internship with **Global Next Consulting India Private Limited (GNCIPL)**.  
The goal is to apply **Unsupervised Learning** techniques for segmenting e-commerce customers.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Project Title:** Customer Segmentation (E-Commerce)  
- **Internship Organization:** Global Next Consulting India Private Limited (GNCIPL)  
- **Techniques Used:** PCA (dimensionality reduction), K-Means clustering, Elbow Method, Silhouette Score  
- **Dataset:** Online Retail / E-Commerce Purchase Data (Kaggle / UCI Repository)  

The objective is to segment customers into **3–5 meaningful groups** based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
As per the internship project list:
1. Data Preprocessing → handle nulls, encode categorical values, normalize RFM features.  
2. Apply **PCA** → reduce dimensionality while retaining maximum variance.  
3. Apply **K-Means Clustering** → segment customers.  
4. Use **Elbow Method & Silhouette Score** → evaluate optimal number of clusters.  
5. Visualize results in 2D using PCA-transformed components.

## 📊 Results
- Customers segmented into 3–5 clusters (e.g., high-value, medium, casual shoppers).  
- PCA helped visualize the customer distribution in 2D.  
- Silhouette Score validated the quality of the clusters.
